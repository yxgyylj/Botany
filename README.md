# Image stuff in life science 
### -- how to produce cool botany images from computer algorithm and biomedical images?
- Use iterative functional system, L-system and Fibonacci Sequence to produce beautiful animations in botany.
- Analysis of biomedical images is essentially data analytics on a 2D data array, so if one wants to recongnize special structures out from the data, it is of a pattern recongization problem. Here I provide two examples -- recogize CT tumor patterns using Rigid and Lasso regression, and build a breast cancer predictor from pre-defined dataset (machine learning).
